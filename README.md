Hello! I'm Deniz, a computer engineering student at Middle East Technical University, currently in the preparatory class. My passion for the world of computers and technology motivates me to learn and explore more every day.

I am actively pursuing additional training in Front-end Development to enhance my skills in this area. My interest in design and user experience drives me to work more effectively on each project.

I closely follow developments in artificial intelligence technologies and focus on constantly acquiring new knowledge to stay abreast of the latest advancements. Adapting to changes in the world of technology, I aim to understand future technological trends and play an effective role in this field.

I am open to continuous self-improvement and eagerly anticipate encountering new opportunities. Teamwork and participation in projects are crucial to me, as they provide opportunities to increase my knowledge and connect with different perspectives.

If you are interested in collaborating in the same fields or sharing experiences, please feel free to reach out. I am excited about the prospect of working together!
